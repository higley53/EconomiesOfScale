<html><h1>Economies of Scale is a game based off the principles of capital goods vs. consumer good.</h1> Capital goods will make your economy grow and allow more output, but will decrease citizen happiness. Vice versa, consumer goods increase citizen happiness, but lead to low growth. 

Citizen happiness can a have a positive or negative impact on your economy. High happiness leads to larger growth, and faster policy power gain, while low happiness can lead to recessions, depressions, negative growth, and low policy power gain. Balancing is an important aspect of the game.

Capital vs. Consumer good balance is influenced by decisions (in the decisions tab) that you purchase with policy power. While you will never have total control over your goods balance, your choices between governments, policies and other decisions will have an effect on what balance you use.</html>
